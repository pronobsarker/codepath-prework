## App Idea: StudySync – Social Study Pods with Real-Time Accountability

**Description:**  
*StudySync* is a productivity app that connects students and learners into small, real-time virtual “study pods.” Each pod runs on a timer (like Pomodoro cycles), where participants can see each other’s progress status (studying, break, stuck, etc.) and optionally enable video check-ins to stay accountable. Users can form friend groups or join public pods based on topic (e.g., “CS Exam Prep” or “GRE Verbal”).

**Planned Features:**  
- Live study sessions with shared timers  
- Status indicators (Studying, Break, Need Help)  
- Anonymous or open Q&A board within each pod  
- Stats dashboard to track study hours and consistency
